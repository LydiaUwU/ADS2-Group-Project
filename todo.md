# Things in italics are things that can be done right now.
## Functionality
### Part 1 (shortest path between stops):
#### Basic functionality (10%):
Works correctly.
#### Edge cases (10%):
*Test edge cases.*

### Part 2 (search for stops by name):
#### Basic functionality (10%):
Works correctly.
#### Edge cases (10%):
*Test edge cases.*


### Part 3 (searching for trips with a given arrival time):
#### Basic functionality (10%):
Works correctly.
#### Edge cases (10%):
Work on basic functionality before doing this.


## Interface (10%)
Works correctly for all 3 parts.

## Demo (10%)
Work on parts 1-3 before doing this.

## 2 page design document (20%)
* Not made yet - work on parts 1-3 before doing this.
* Part 1 uses Dijkstra's algorithm, part 2 uses TST, all parts use arrayLists etc, check the code of each part to see what are the main data structures used.*

## Readme.txt
Work on parts 1-3 before doing this.
